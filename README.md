# Azure WebApp Flask AD Integration Demo

### What's this all about?

It's a demo based on the [ms-identity-python-webapp](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-webapp) repo. This one explores more features of Flask such as Blueprints, the App Factory pattern and also integrates more tightly with the App Services environment and pretends to be integrated within Azure DevOps Pipelines. (Also showcases a prettier UI!)
